Given an array of integers and a number n, your task is to find all occurrences of elements in the array that are less than or equal to n.

You need to implement a function solution_2(data, n) that takes two parameters:

- data: a list of integers.
- n: an integer.

The function should return a list containing all elements from the input data where the count of the element is less than or equal to n.
